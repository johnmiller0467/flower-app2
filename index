        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>Petal &amp; Hearth began as a small studio with a simple idea: flowers bring people together. Founded by two florists who met while styling a friend's wedding, we grew from weekend markets to a full-service shop that serves our neighborhood with daily deliveries, event design, and floral education.</p>
        <p>We prioritize seasonal sourcing, fair partnerships with growers, and low-waste design practices. Our work balances garden-inspired abundance with clean, modern lines — we like arrangements that feel intimate and lived-in rather than overly sculpted. Most importantly, we listen: every order starts with a short conversation so the bouquet suits the person and the occasion.</p>

      <section id="shop">
        <h2>Shop: Bouquets, Arrangements &amp; Gifts</h2>
        <p>Everything in our shop is designed and arranged by our team the same day as delivery or pickup (when possible). Browse categories below; each product page lists size options and care instructions.</p>

        <div class="two">
          <div>
            <h3>Everyday Bouquets</h3>
            <p>Bright, unfussy bouquets perfect for celebrations, thank-yous, or to brighten a room. Available in three sizes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Small</strong> — 6–9 stems, ideal for desks or bedside tables.</li>
              <li><strong>Medium</strong> — 12–16 stems, our most popular option for gifting.</li>
              <li><strong>Large</strong> — 20+ stems for impactful, statement bouquets.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Signature Collections</h3>
            <p>Curated seasonal palettes that reflect what’s at peak right now — soft pastels in early spring, sun-soaked tones in summer, rich jewel hues in autumn, and warm, cozy combinations in winter. These change frequently to keep your gifts fresh and surprising.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Specialty &amp; Gift Items</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Wedding &amp; Event Flowers:</strong> Full-service design with proposals, trials, and on-site installation.</li>
          <li><strong>Sympathy Arrangements:</strong> Wreaths, sprays, and sympathy bouquets created with care and respect.</li>
          <li><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> Weekly, biweekly, or monthly deliveries of seasonal bouquets for home or office.</li>
          <li><strong>Gift Add-ons:</strong> Handwritten notes, small-batch chocolates, artisan vase options, and flower-care kits.</li>
        </ul>

      <section id="our-style">
        <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
        <p>We design with intention, guided by three principles:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Seasonality:</strong> Choosing stems that are at their peak, locally or regionally, for color and scent.</li>
          <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Mixing structured blooms with airy foliage to create movement and balance.</li>
          <li><strong>Story:</strong> Each arrangement should feel personal — selected with the recipient, space, and moment in mind.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Our aesthetic sits between garden-wild and refined minimalism: loose tapestries of foliage, unexpectedly paired colors, and a focus on stems that perform well in the vase.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="weddings">
        <h2>Weddings &amp; Events</h2>
        <p>We offer collaborative wedding design for couples who want blooms that feel honest and memorable. Below is how we typically work with clients:</p>
        <h3>Our Process</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Initial Consultation:</strong> Discuss style, priorities, guest count, and budget.</li>
          <li><strong>Proposal &amp; Mood Board:</strong> Visual plan with example palettes, focal pieces, and pricing tiers.</li>
          <li><strong>Trial/Mockup:</strong> Optional bouquet trial or centerpiece sample to confirm scale and mood.</li>
          <li><strong>Logistics:</strong> Coordination with venue and vendors for delivery windows, access, and setup.</li>
          <li><strong>Installation &amp; Breakdown:</strong> On-site team manages setup and post-event breakdown if requested.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">Tip: Reserve your florist early (6–12 months in peak season) and have a flexible flower list for best pricing and availability.</p>

      <section id="care">
        <h2>Flower Care Tips</h2>
        <p>Simple care extends the life of your bouquet. Follow these steps for best results:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cut stems at an angle before placing them in fresh water; re-cut every 2–3 days.</li>
          <li>Change water every 48 hours and clean the vase to reduce bacteria.</li>
          <li>Remove leaves below the waterline to prevent rot.</li>
          <li>Keep arrangements away from direct heat, sunlight, and fruit.</li>
          <li>Use flower food included with the bouquet, or make a home remedy with a small pinch of sugar and a few drops of bleach.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some blooms — like hydrangea — drink more water, while succulents need very little. If you’re unsure, check the product care card or contact us.</p>

      <section id="flowers-quickguide">
        <h2>Quick Guide: Popular Stems</h2>
        <p>Here are a few favorites we use often, what to expect, and symbolic meanings.</p>
        <h3>Roses</h3>
        <p>Durable and versatile. Red = love, white = purity, pink = gratitude. Trim stems and keep cool.</p>

        <h3>Peonies</h3>
        <p>Full, luxurious blooms available in late spring. Handle gently and avoid direct sun.</p>

        <h3>Tulips</h3>
        <p>Bright, modern stems that continue to open in the vase. Trim to control height.</p>

        <h3>Dahlias</h3>
        <p>Dramatic and sculptural; excellent for late-summer arrangements. Provide sturdy support if needed.</p>
